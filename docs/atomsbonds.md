#  Atoms, Bonds and Molecules

## Atoms

The CDK interface <topic type="class">IAtom</topic> is the underlying data model of atoms. Creating
a new atom is fairly easy. For example, we can create an atom of element
type carbon, as defined by the elementâ€™s atomic number that we pass as parameter
in the constructor:

**Script** [code/CreateAtom3.py](code/CreateAtom3.code.md)
```python
atom = Atom(6);
print(atom)
```
