## Atoms

The CDK interface <a name="tp1">IAtom</a> is the underlying data model of atoms. Creating
a new atom is fairly easy. For example, we can create an atom of element
type carbon, as defined by the elementâ€™s atomic number that we pass as parameter
in the constructor:

<code>CreateAtom3</code>
